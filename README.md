# Simple-Bot
Currently working on a bot that has a range of basic to advanced commands. Some commands may be fun such as rock-paper-scissors, or it could be checking the amount of players that are in the server.

I will be adding new commands overtime.

Currently in the works :

Basic Commands :
    Clear Command - Clears certain amount of messages in discord (DONE)
    Rock-Paper-Scissor - Plays Rock-Paper-Scissor with the user (DONE)
    Flip Coin - Flips a coin for the user
    Randomizer - Randomizes a list that the user wants (In Progress)
    Ping Checker : Checks ping for discord (DONE)
    Member Join/Leave : Notifies server if member has joined or left the server (DONE)


Advanced Commands : 
    Coronavirus Info - Checks out the current status of the pandemic in the United States
        Information that will be provided :
            - Amount of confirmed cases
            - Amount of confirmed cases that was obtained today
            - Total Deaths
    Reddit Subreddit Notifier - Sends a message when a new post is posted in a subreddit
