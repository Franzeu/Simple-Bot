# Simple-Bot
Currently working on a bot that has a range of basic to advanced commands. Some commands may be fun such as rock-paper-scissors, or it could be checking the amount of players that are in the server. Not an official bot at the moment (Might change overtime), this is used to test my coding knowledge with python.

I will be adding new commands overtime.
