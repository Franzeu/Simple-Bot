# Simple-Bot
Made a bot that contained simple and easy commands. Through making this, I was trying to test my python knowledge skills and understanding discord.py. Nothing crazy, just using this to learn git, github, and the python.

## Basic Commands :
    Clear Command - Clears certain amount of messages in discord (DONE) 
    
    Rock-Paper-Scissor - Plays Rock-Paper-Scissor with the user (DONE)
    
    Flip Coin - Flips a coin (DONE)
    
    Ping Checker : Checks ping for discord (DONE)
    
    Member Join/Leave : Notifies server if member has joined or left the server (DONE)
    
    Kick / Ban : Mods or higher are able to kick or ban users from the server (DONE)
